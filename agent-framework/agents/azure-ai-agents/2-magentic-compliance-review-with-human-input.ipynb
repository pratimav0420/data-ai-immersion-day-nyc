    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **interactive plan review** in Magentic workflows for financial services - enabling compliance oversight and modification of research plans before execution. This pattern is essential for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure research follows SEC/FINRA guidelines\n",
    "2. **Risk Management**: Human approval for client-facing materials\n",
    "3. **Quality Assurance**: Verify AI-generated research methodology\n",
    "4. **Iterative Refinement**: Collaborate with AI to optimize research approach\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Financial Services Disclaimer**: This notebook demonstrates AI agent workflows for educational purposes. In production, all investment research must be reviewed by compliance before distribution.\n",
