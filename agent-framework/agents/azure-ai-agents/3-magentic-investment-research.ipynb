    "# 🏦 Magentic Multi-Agent Orchestration for Investment Research\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **Magentic orchestration** for financial services - an advanced multi-agent coordination pattern for comprehensive investment research and analysis. The orchestrator automatically manages research task decomposition, specialist agent selection, and insight synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Financial Services Disclaimer**: This notebook demonstrates AI agent workflows for educational purposes. In production, all investment research and recommendations must comply with regulatory requirements (SEC, FINRA) and include appropriate disclosures.\n",
