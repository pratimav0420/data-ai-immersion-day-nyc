    "Welcome to the **Loan Calculator Agent** tutorial, where we'll showcase how to:\n",
    "1. **Initialize** a project and use the Microsoft Foundry ecosystem\n",
    "2. **Create an Agent** with **Code Interpreter** capabilities\n",
    "3. **Perform loan calculations** such as monthly payments, amortization schedules, and interest analysis\n",
    "4. **Analyze financial data** with sample loan portfolio data\n",
    "5. **Generate** financial insights with appropriate disclaimers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's Dive In\n",
    "We'll walk step-by-step, similar to our **Financial Services Advisor** sample, but with a focus on using **Code Interpreter** for loan calculations and financial data analysis. Let's begin!"
