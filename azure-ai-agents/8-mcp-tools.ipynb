    "# 🔌 Agents with Foundry MCP Server\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our **Foundry MCP Server** tutorial! In this notebook, we'll demonstrate how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand** the Foundry MCP Server and its capabilities\n",
    "2. **Configure** an MCP tool connection in Microsoft Foundry\n",
    "3. **Create an Agent** with MCP tools to access Foundry capabilities\n",
    "4. **Handle MCP approval requests** for secure tool access\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔌 What is Foundry MCP Server?\n",
    "> [Foundry MCP Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/mcp/get-started) is a **cloud-hosted MCP service** at `https://mcp.ai.azure.com` that provides:\n",
    "> - **Model Discovery**: Explore and compare models from the Foundry catalog\n",
    "> - **Model Deployment**: Check quotas and deploy models\n",
    "> - **Agent Management**: Create and manage AI agents\n",
    "> - **Evaluation**: Run evaluations and quality assessments\n",
    "> - **Knowledge Integration**: Work with Azure AI Search indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌟 Why Foundry MCP Server?\n",
    "| Feature | Benefit |\n",
    "|---------|---------|\n",
    "| **Cloud-hosted** | No local server setup required |\n",
    "| **Entra ID Authentication** | Secure OAuth 2.0 with user-specific permissions |\n",
    "| **Curated Tools** | Pre-built tools for common Foundry operations |\n",
    "| **Scalable** | Built with cloud-scale reliability |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Microsoft Foundry project with appropriate permissions\n",
    "- **Foundry MCP Server connection** configured in your project (see setup below)\n",
    "- A `.env` file in the parent directory containing:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=<your-ai-foundry-project-endpoint>\n",
    "  AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<supported-model>\n",
    "  TENANT_ID=<your-azure-tenant-id>\n",
    "  FOUNDRY_MCP_CONNECTION_ID=<connection-id-from-foundry-portal>  # See setup below\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Setting up Foundry MCP Server Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: Before using MCP tools in code, you must create a connection in the Foundry portal:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Navigate to Foundry Tools\n",
    "1. Go to [Microsoft Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com)\n",
    "2. Select your project\n",
    "3. Navigate to **Build** → **Tools**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Add Foundry MCP Server\n",
    "1. Click **Add tool** → **Catalog**\n",
    "2. Search for \"Foundry MCP Server (preview)\"\n",
    "3. Select it and click **Create**\n",
    "4. The connection will be created with OAuth authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Get Connection ID\n",
    "1. After creating the connection, click on it to view details\n",
    "2. Copy the **Project connection ID** from the details page\n",
    "3. Add it to your `.env` file as `FOUNDRY_MCP_CONNECTION_ID`\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"seq-diagrams/foundry-mcp-connection-id.png\" width=\"80%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: The Project connection ID follows this format:\n",
    "> `/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{account}/projects/{project}/connections/FoundryMCPServerpreview`\n",

    "## 📚 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we learned how to use the **Foundry MCP Server** to enhance AI agents with Foundry capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Setup Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Configure in Portal**: Create MCP connection in Microsoft Foundry portal\n",
    "2. **Get Connection ID**: Copy the connection ID from the portal\n",
    "3. **Add to .env**: Set `FOUNDRY_MCP_CONNECTION_ID` in your environment\n",
    "4. **Create Agent**: Use `MCPTool` with `project_connection_id`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concept | Description |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Foundry MCP Server** | Cloud-hosted MCP service at `https://mcp.ai.azure.com` |\n",
    "| **MCPTool** | Tool configuration for connecting to the server |\n",
    "| **project_connection_id** | **Required** - Connection configured in Foundry portal |\n",
    "| **Entra ID Auth** | Secure authentication with user-specific permissions |\n",
    "| **Approval Flow** | Security feature requiring user consent |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Foundry MCP Server Tool Categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Example Tools | Use Cases |\n",
    "|----------|--------------|-----------|\n",
    "| **Models** | `model_catalog_list`, `model_deploy`, `model_quota_list` | Explore, compare, and deploy AI models |\n",
    "| **Evaluations** | `evaluation_create`, `evaluation_get` | Quality and safety assessments |\n",
    "| **Agents** | `agent_update`, `agent_list` | Agent lifecycle management |\n",
    "| **Knowledge** | `index_list`, `query_index` | Azure AI Search integration |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Prompts for Foundry MCP Server:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Model Exploration\n",
    "\"What OpenAI models are available in Microsoft Foundry?\"\n",
    "\"Compare Phi models and explain their differences\"\n",
    "\"What models are good for reasoning tasks?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Deployment\n",
    "\"What quota do I have available for GPT-4o?\"\n",
    "\"Help me deploy a model for my project\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluation\n",
    "\"How do I evaluate my agent's quality?\"\n",
    "\"What evaluators are available for text generation?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# General Use Cases\n",
    "\"Recommend models for document analysis\"\n",
    "\"What models have appropriate licensing for enterprise use?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔐 Security Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Foundry MCP Server uses **Entra ID authentication**\n",
    "- ✅ All operations run under **user's Azure RBAC permissions**\n",
    "- ✅ Every activity is **logged for auditing**\n",
    "- ✅ Use `require_approval=\"never\"` for simpler demos, or `\"always\"` for production with manual approval\n",
    "- ✅ Tenant admins can enforce access via **Azure Policy**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Using Foundry MCP Server in VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use Foundry MCP Server directly in VS Code with GitHub Copilot:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open VS Code with GitHub Copilot enabled\n",
    "2. Add to `.vscode/mcp.json`:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"servers\": {\n",
    "    \"foundry-mcp-remote\": {\n",
    "      \"type\": \"http\",\n",
    "      \"url\": \"https://mcp.ai.azure.com\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Start chatting with Copilot using Foundry tools!\n",
