    "   - \"Given your conservative risk tolerance...\"\n",

    "   - \"Do you prefer aggressive or conservative strategies?\"\n",

    "\n",
    "### What You Built\n",
    "\n",
    "| Component | Description |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Memory Store** | Persistent storage for customer preferences and conversation summaries |\n",
    "| **Memory Search Tool** | Agent tool that retrieves and updates memories |\n",
    "| **Banking Agent** | AI assistant that uses memories for personalization |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory Extraction** - Automatically extract preferences from conversations\n",
    "2. **Memory Recall** - Retrieve relevant memories in new conversations\n",
    "3. **Memory Updates** - Handle changing customer preferences over time\n",
    "4. **Scoped Memories** - Isolate memories per customer for privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industry Use Cases for Agent Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "| Use Case | Memory Benefit |\n",
    "|----------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Wealth Management** | Remember risk tolerance, investment preferences, financial goals |\n",
    "| **Customer Service** | Recall past issues, preferred communication channels, account history |\n",
    "| **Loan Processing** | Remember document submissions, employment history, property details |\n",
    "| **Insurance** | Recall policy preferences, claims history, coverage requirements |\n",
    "| **Fraud Detection** | Remember customer behavior patterns, typical transaction types |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "| Consideration | Recommendation |\n",
    "|---------------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Update Delay** | Set to 300+ seconds (5 min) to avoid extraction during active conversations |\n",
    "| **Scope Strategy** | Use customer IDs or `{{$userId}}` for automatic user isolation |\n",
    "| **Memory Retention** | Consider data retention policies and GDPR compliance |\n",
    "| **Sensitive Data** | Avoid storing PII or sensitive financial data in memories |\n",
