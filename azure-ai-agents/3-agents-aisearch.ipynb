    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "1. An **Azure AI Search** resource (formerly \"Cognitive Search\"), provisioned in your Microsoft Foundry project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "- ✅ **Azure AI Search**: Create indexes for financial products, upload documents, perform semantic searches\n",
    "- ✅ **Agent Service**: Create AI agents with banking product knowledge\n",
    "- ✅ **Integration Patterns**: Connect search functionality with AI agents for product recommendations\n",
    "- ✅ **Best Practices**: Error handling, resource cleanup, financial disclaimers\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-Level Flow\n",
    "We'll do the following:\n",
    "1. **Create** an AI Search index with sample banking products data.\n",
    "2. **Upload** documents (credit cards, loans, accounts) to the index.\n",
    "3. **Verify** search functionality with test queries.\n",
    "4. **Create** an AI agent with banking product expertise and proper disclaimers.\n",
    "5. **Test** agent conversations about financial products.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before proceeding with this tutorial, you need to create an Azure AI Search connection in your AI Foundry project.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Create the connection with **API Key** authentication (not AAD/Entra ID) to avoid permission issues with the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steps to Create the Connection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigate to Microsoft Foundry portal**: https://ai.azure.com/\n",
    "2. **Go to your project** → **Settings** → **Connections**\n",
    "3. **Click \"New Connection\"** → **Azure AI Search**\n",
    "4. **Provide the following details:**\n",
    "   - **Connection Name**: Give it a descriptive name (e.g., \"my-ai-search\")\n",
    "   - **Authentication**: ⚠️ **Select API Key** (NOT AAD/Entra ID)\n",
    "   - **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription\n",
    "   - **Resource Group**: Choose your resource group\n",
    "   - **Azure AI Search Resource**: Select your existing search service or create a new one\n",
    "5. **Click \"Add Connection\"** to complete the setup\n",
    "6. **📝 Note down your connection name** - you'll need it in the agent creation cell below!\n",
    "\n",
    "### **⚠️ Important Notes:**\n",
    "- The connection must be created **before** running the code below\n",
    "- **Use API Key authentication** for the connection (AAD/Entra ID auth has permission issues with agents)\n",
    "- **Write down your connection name** - update the `ai_search_connection_name` variable in the agent creation cell\n",
    "- If you don't have an Azure AI Search resource, you'll need to create one first\n",

    "# 🎉 Congratulations!\n",
    "\n",
    "You've successfully completed the **AI Search + Agent Service with Vector Search** tutorial!\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ **What We Accomplished**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **🔍 Azure AI Search with Vector Search & Semantic Configuration**\n",
    "   - Created a search index with **vector embeddings** for semantic search\n",
    "   - Configured **HNSW algorithm** for efficient vector similarity search\n",
    "   - Used **Azure OpenAI embeddings** (text-embedding-ada-002) to vectorize product descriptions\n",
    "   - Implemented **integrated vectorization** with AzureOpenAIVectorizer\n",
    "   - Added **Semantic Configuration** (required for SEMANTIC query type)\n",
    "   - Included price information in embeddings for better context understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **🤖 AI Agent with Semantic Search Capabilities**  \n",
    "   - Created an agent using **SEMANTIC query type** (powered by vector embeddings)\n",
    "   - Agent understands semantic meaning and can find products based on:\n",
    "     - **Categories** (\"strength training\", \"cardio\", \"flexibility\")\n",
    "     - **Use cases** (\"muscle recovery\", \"home gym\", \"conditioning\")\n",
    "     - **Concepts** (\"affordable\", \"budget-friendly\", \"full-body\")\n",
    "     - **Natural language** queries without exact keyword matches\n",
    "   - Seamless integration with real-time semantic search results\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **💡 Key Improvements Over Simple Search**\n",
    "   - **Semantic Understanding**: Finds relevant items based on meaning, not just keywords\n",
    "   - **Context Awareness**: Understands \"muscle recovery\" → foam roller, yoga mat\n",
    "   - **Better Relevance**: Returns results based on semantic similarity\n",
    "   - **Richer Embeddings**: Combined name, category, description, and price in vector embeddings\n",
    "   - **Natural Language**: Understands intent from conversational queries\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **📊 Technical Implementation**\n",
    "   - **Vector Field**: `DescriptionVector` with 1536 dimensions\n",
    "   - **Vector Search**: HNSW algorithm for fast approximate nearest neighbor search\n",
    "   - **Semantic Config**: Required for SEMANTIC query type with Name, Description, Category fields\n",
    "   - **Manual Vectorization**: Pre-computed embeddings using Azure OpenAI\n",
    "   - **Official SDK**: Uses `azure-search-documents` and `azure-ai-agents` packages\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **How Vector Search Works in This Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Indexing Time**:\n",
    "   - Documents are enriched with text combining all relevant fields + price\n",
    "   - Azure OpenAI generates 1536-dimensional embeddings\n",
    "   - Embeddings stored in `DescriptionVector` field\n",
    "   - HNSW algorithm creates efficient search structure\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query Time**:\n",
    "   - User asks a natural language question to the agent\n",
    "   - Agent uses SEMANTIC search (leverages pre-computed vectors)\n",
    "   - Search returns most semantically similar items\n",
    "   - Agent formats results with prices and details\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Query (Natural Language)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "AI Agent (SEMANTIC query type)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Azure AI Search Index\n",
    "    ├─ Traditional fields (Name, Price, Category)\n",
    "    └─ Vector field (DescriptionVector with embeddings)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 **Key Learnings**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Search Types**:\n",
    "   - **VECTOR query type**: Requires runtime vectorization (authentication challenges)\n",
    "   - **SEMANTIC query type**: Uses pre-computed vectors (what we implemented)\n",
    "   - Both leverage the same vector index and embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Semantic Configuration**:\n",
    "   - Required for SEMANTIC query type\n",
    "   - Defines title, content, and keyword fields\n",
    "   - Improves relevance ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Embedding Strategy**:\n",
    "   - Include all relevant context in text for embedding\n",
    "   - Price information embedded as text: \"Price: $59.99\"\n",
    "   - Enables semantic understanding of price concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Best Query Patterns for Semantic Search**:\n",
    "   - ✅ **Good**: \"affordable strength training equipment\" (concepts)\n",
    "   - ✅ **Good**: \"equipment for muscle recovery\" (use cases)\n",
    "   - ✅ **Good**: \"budget-friendly home gym options\" (categories)\n",
    "   - ❌ **Limited**: \"show items under $50\" (exact numerical filters)\n",
    "   - ❌ **Limited**: \"what's the cheapest item\" (superlatives requiring sorting)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **When to Use What**:\n",
    "   - **Semantic Search**: Best for understanding intent, categories, concepts\n",
    "   - **Filters**: Best for exact numerical ranges (combine with OData: `Price le 100`)\n",
    "   - **Hybrid**: Combine semantic search + filters for best results\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 **Next Steps & Improvements**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add OData Filters**: Combine semantic search with exact price filters\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   filter=\"Price le 100\"  # Combine with semantic search\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hybrid Search**: Combine keyword search + vector search\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   search_text=\"strength\",  # Keyword search\n",
    "   vector_queries=[vector_query]  # Vector search\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Semantic Ranker**: Enable L2 semantic ranking for better relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multi-field Vectors**: Create separate vectors for different aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Query Expansion**: Let agent rephrase queries for better results\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎓 **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic Search Excels At**:\n",
    "- Understanding natural language and intent\n",
    "- Finding items by category, use case, or concept\n",
    "- Providing contextually relevant results\n",
    "- Handling synonyms and related terms\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Exact Filtering, Add**:\n",
    "- OData filters for price ranges\n",
    "- Traditional field filters\n",
    "- Faceting for categorical filtering\n",
