    "\n",
    "Welcome to our **Financial Market Research Agent with Bing Grounding** tutorial! In this notebook, we'll demonstrate how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize** a project using Microsoft Foundry.\n",
    "2. **Create an Agent** with the **BingGroundingTool** for real-time web search.\n",
    "3. **Ask real-world questions** about market trends, interest rates, and financial news.\n",
    "4. **Retrieve and display** answers with real-time market data and appropriate disclaimers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Important Model Support Note ⚠️\n",
    "> Bing grounding is currently only supported in certain Azure OpenAI models (e.g. `gpt-4o-0513`).\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Make sure you specify a supported model and set the `\"x-ms-enable-preview\": \"true\"` header.\n",

    "1. **Environment Variables** - Use the correct variable names from your `.env` file\n",
    "2. **API Parameters** - Use `name=` parameter for connection retrieval\n",
    "3. **Tool Configuration** - Ensure `search_configurations` is a proper array\n",
    "4. **Connection Testing** - List available connections when debugging\n",
    "5. **Resource Management** - Always clean up agents and resources\n",
    "6. **Health Disclaimers** - Maintain medical advice disclaimers even with real-time data\n",
    "7. **Source Transparency** - Leverage web search citations for credibility\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Guide**\n",
    "\n",
    "**If Bing grounding fails:**\n",
    "1. ✅ Check `GROUNDING_WITH_BING_CONNECTION_NAME` in `.env` file\n",
    "2. ✅ Use `name=` parameter in `connections.get()` call\n",
    "3. ✅ Ensure `search_configurations` is an array with exactly 1 element\n",
    "4. ✅ Verify the Bing connection exists in Microsoft Foundry\n",
    "5. ✅ List available connections for debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "**For connection errors:**\n",
