    "# 📊 Agent Telemetry & Tracing for Wealth Management Advisory\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement **telemetry and tracing** for AI agents using Azure Monitor and OpenTelemetry. We'll build a **Wealth Management Advisory Agent** that provides investment guidance while capturing detailed traces for monitoring, debugging, and compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Configure Azure Monitor** for agent telemetry\n",
    "2. **Enable content recording** to capture prompts and responses\n",
    "3. **Create custom trace spans** for business-specific context\n",
    "4. **View traces** in Microsoft Foundry and Application Insights\n",
    "5. **Understand trace data** for compliance and debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💼 Industry Use Case: Wealth Management Advisory\n",
    "\n",
    "In wealth management, telemetry is critical for:\n",
    "- **Regulatory Compliance**: Track all advisor-client interactions\n",
    "- **Audit Trail**: Maintain records of investment recommendations\n",
    "- **Performance Monitoring**: Measure response times and quality\n",
    "- **Risk Management**: Detect anomalies in agent behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Financial Disclaimer\n",
    "> **The financial information provided is for educational purposes only and is not investment advice.** Always consult with qualified financial advisors before making investment decisions.\n",

    "## 🎯 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you learned how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Configure Azure Monitor** for agent telemetry with OpenTelemetry  \n",
    "✅ **Enable content recording** to capture prompts and responses for compliance  \n",
    "✅ **Create custom trace spans** with business-specific attributes  \n",
    "✅ **Build a Wealth Management Advisor** with full observability  \n",
    "✅ **Track client interactions** with compliance-ready telemetry  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Key APIs Used\n",
    "\n",
    "| API | Purpose |\n",
    "|-----|--------|\n",
    "| `configure_azure_monitor()` | Set up Azure Monitor exporter |\n",
    "| `trace.get_tracer()` | Get a tracer for custom spans |\n",
    "| `tracer.start_as_current_span()` | Create custom trace spans |\n",
    "| `span.set_attribute()` | Add business context to traces |\n",
    "| `format_trace_id()` | Get readable trace ID for debugging |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **View traces** in Microsoft Foundry portal or Application Insights\n",
    "2. **Set up alerts** for anomalous response times or error rates\n",
    "3. **Create dashboards** for compliance reporting\n",
    "4. **Explore evaluation** in `2-evaluation.ipynb` to assess agent quality\n",
